# Random_Fact_Quiz

My goal with this is to create a timed multiple choice quiz that will keep score and let you save the score. If you answer the question correctly it will move on to the next question, but if you answer incorrectly extra time will come off the clock. The game ends when the time runs out or after you answer all 10 questions.

## Usage Instructions
This project is still not functional.<br>
I need to make some aesthetic adjustments.<br>
My counter that keeps track of the score isn't working properly so the correct scores cannot be saved.<br>
Sometimes the questions do not show up in the proper order.
